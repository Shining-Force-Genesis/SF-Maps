Recreated Shining Force Series Maps

## Tooling

Currently all the maps are going to be created in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) [(latest download link)](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled/releases).

Support and documentation will be written eventually on how to use Aseprite and Photoshop as well.
